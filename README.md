## 🔄 Auto Sync Details
[![Sync Gist Files](https://github.com/almahmudbd/Useful-lists/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/almahmudbd/Useful-lists/actions/workflows/main.yml)
This repository auto-syncs several personal Gist files every 6 hours using GitHub Actions. 
The sync is handled using cURL to fetch raw Gist files and then commit changes only if there are updates.  
You can check the workflow inside `.github/workflows/sync-gist.yml`.
